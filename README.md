# Overview

This is my software to say "Hello World"

This software is just to greet the world with an 'Hello'

The purpose for creating this is to meet the week 1 requirement and demonstrate understanding of assignment instruction for Applied programming CSE310. 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
